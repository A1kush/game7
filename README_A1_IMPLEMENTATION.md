# Game7 - A1 Melee Combat Implementation

## 🎯 Requirements Implementation Summary

This implementation successfully addresses all requirements from the problem statement:

### ✅ A1 Character Combat Mechanics (COMPLETE)

**A1 is now a melee attacker and does NOT shoot beam attacks:**
- ✅ Basic attack is a 5-hit sword combo (no projectiles)
- ✅ Each swing reflects 2-5 bullets automatically  
- ✅ Visible slash VFX generated for each melee hit
- ✅ S1 "Umbral Crescent" is the ONLY projectile skill (energy wave exception)
- ✅ All other skills (S2-S4, R1, X1) are melee-based

**Bullet Reflection System:**
- ✅ Basic attack reflects 2-5 bullets per swing
- ✅ S3 "Mirror Reversal" parry reflects 10+ bullets  
- ✅ Visual feedback for bullet reflection events

### ✅ HTML Game Integration (COMPLETE)

**"too many giftboxes.html" Integration:**
- ✅ File copied from `Runner 7/too many giftboxes.html` to `game.html`
- ✅ Python-JavaScript bridge implemented for full integration
- ✅ Web server provides HTML game at `http://localhost:8080/game`
- ✅ Real-time API communication between Python backend and HTML frontend

### ✅ Team Survival System (COMPLETE)

**Three-Hero Squad:**
- ✅ A1 (Boss Slayer), Unique (Mob Slayer), Missy (Support/Loot)
- ✅ Individual HP tracking for each character
- ✅ Only ends when ALL three heroes are defeated
- ✅ Team Status UI tracking implemented

**Revival System:**
- ✅ 40-60 second revival cooldown when defeated
- ✅ Revive Tokens can skip cooldown for instant revival
- ✅ Auto character switching when active character defeated

### ✅ Six-Skill Combat System (COMPLETE)

**Full Skill Kit per Character:**
- ✅ S1-S4: Core skills implemented
- ✅ R1: Manual Rage mode with 0.4s invulnerability
- ✅ X1: Secret skill with 20% HP cost and 0.4s invulnerability

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Python Demo
```bash
# Run the interactive demonstration
python3 demo_a1_melee.py

# View A1 melee combat features
# Test bullet reflection
# Experience team survival system
```

### Option 2: Integrated Web Game
```bash
# Start the web server
python3 game_bridge.py

# Open browser to: http://localhost:8080/game
# Full HTML game with Python backend integration
```

### Option 3: API Testing
```bash
# Run tests to validate implementation
python3 -m pytest test_a1_melee.py -v

# Test specific A1 mechanics
python3 -m pytest test_a1_melee.py::TestA1MeleeCombat -v
```

## 🎮 Key Features Demonstrated

### A1 Melee Combat
```python
from game_engine import GameEngine

engine = GameEngine()
a1 = engine.get_character('A1')

# Execute 5-hit melee combo
result = a1.use_basic_attack()
print(f"Hits: {result['hit_count']}")        # 5
print(f"Melee: {result['is_melee']}")        # True  
print(f"Reflects: {result['bullet_reflect_count']}")  # 2-5 bullets

# A1 cannot shoot beams (melee only)
print(f"Is melee attacker: {a1.stats.is_melee_attacker}")  # True
```

### Bullet Reflection
```python
# Test bullet reflection system
reflection = engine.reflect_bullets('A1', 8)  # 8 incoming bullets
print(f"Reflected: {reflection['reflected_bullets']}")  # Max 5 per swing
```

### Invulnerability Frames
```python
# Rage skill grants 0.4s invulnerability
a1.stats.rage = 60
a1.use_skill(SkillType.R1)
print(f"Invulnerable: {a1.is_invulnerable()}")  # True for 0.4s

# Secret skill grants 0.4s invulnerability  
a1.stats.secret_gauge = 100
a1.use_skill(SkillType.X1)
print(f"Invulnerable: {a1.is_invulnerable()}")  # True for 0.4s
```

### Team Survival
```python
# Defeat and revival system
engine.defeat_character('A1')
print(f"Active: {engine.active_character}")  # Auto-switches to living member

# Instant revival with token
engine.revive_character('A1', instant=True)
print(f"A1 revived: {not a1.stats.is_defeated}")  # True
```

## 🌐 Web Integration

The HTML game is fully integrated with the Python backend:

**API Endpoints:**
- `/api/team_status` - Real-time team status
- `/api/basic_attack` - Execute A1 melee combo  
- `/api/use_skill` - Cast character skills
- `/api/switch_character` - Change active character
- `/api/character_info` - Detailed character data

**JavaScript Bridge:**
```javascript
// Access from HTML game
window.game7Bridge.executeA1MeleeCombo()  // Triggers 5-hit combo
window.game7Bridge.useSkill('S3', 'A1')   // Use A1's parry skill
window.game7Bridge.switchCharacter('Unique')  // Switch to Unique
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**19 comprehensive tests covering:**
- A1 melee-only combat mechanics
- Bullet reflection system  
- Invulnerability frame timing
- Team survival and revival
- Character switching
- API integration
- Serialization compatibility

All tests pass and validate the implementation meets requirements.

## 🎯 Implementation Notes

**Minimal Changes Approach:**
- Enhanced existing `game_engine.py` with new combat mechanics
- Added bridge module for HTML integration without modifying existing code
- Preserved all existing functionality while adding new features
- Used composition over modification for seamless integration

**Performance Optimized:**
- Efficient bullet reflection calculations
- Minimal memory footprint for VFX tracking  
- Fast API responses for real-time gameplay
- Lightweight character state management

The implementation successfully delivers all requirements while maintaining the existing codebase structure and functionality.
