# Enhanced Game Automation Features

This document describes the three enhanced features implemented for the A1 Runner game automation system.

## üõí 1. Enhanced Autosell System

### Overview
The autosell system has been completely rewritten to provide better control over item selling with predefined pricing and quality preservation.

### Features
- **Predefined Pricing Table**: 
  - Common items: 100 Gold
  - Gift boxes: 200 Gold
  - Rare/Epic/Legendary items: Not sold (preserved)
- **Quality Preservation**: Automatically preserves Rare, Epic, and Legendary quality gear
- **Detailed Feedback**: Shows exactly how many items were sold and total gold earned
- **Safe Processing**: Processes items from end to start to avoid index issues

### Usage
Click the "Auto Sell" button in the inventory toolbar. The system will:
1. Scan all inventory items
2. Sell Common items and Gift boxes according to the pricing table
3. Preserve all Rare, Epic, and Legendary items
4. Display results showing items sold and gold earned

### Code Location
Function: `autoSell()` in `index.html` (lines 4105-4158)

## üéÅ 2. Enhanced Gift Opening System

### Overview
The gift opening system has been improved to handle large quantities of gifts without freezing the UI.

### Features
- **Responsive Batch Processing**: Processes gifts in batches of 5 to keep UI responsive
- **Improved Reward System**: Uses proper rarity distribution for gift contents
- **Better Feedback**: Shows progress and final count of opened gifts
- **No UI Freezing**: Uses setTimeout to prevent browser freezing during bulk operations

### Rarity Distribution
- Common: 60% chance (ATK: 2)
- Rare: 25% chance (ATK: 4) 
- Epic: 11% chance (ATK: 6)
- Legendary: 4% chance (ATK: 8)

### Usage
Click the "Open All" button in the inventory toolbar. The system will:
1. Identify all gift boxes in inventory
2. Process them in batches with UI updates between batches
3. Create new items with proper rarity distribution
4. Update inventory and stats when complete

### Code Location
Function: `openAllGifts()` in `index.html` (lines 4237-4289)

## ‚öîÔ∏è 3. Multi-Hero Auto Equip System

### Overview
A comprehensive auto equip system that distributes optimal gear across all three heroes (A1, Unique, Missy) without item conflicts.

### Features
- **Multi-Hero Support**: Equips all three heroes simultaneously
- **Advanced Scoring**: Uses ATK + DEF + rank weight for optimal gear selection
- **No Item Conflicts**: Each item can only be equipped to one hero
- **Smart Replacement**: Only replaces currently equipped items if new item is better
- **Rank Weighting**: S=10, A=7, B=4, C=1 points added to score

### Scoring System
```
Item Score = ATK + DEF + Rank Weight
```

### Equipment Priority
1. Items are sorted by score (highest first)
2. Best available items are distributed to heroes in order: A1, Unique, Missy
3. Each slot (weapon, armor, acc1, acc2) is filled with the best available item
4. Previously equipped items are returned to inventory if replaced

### Usage
Click the "Auto Equip" button in the inventory toolbar. The system will:
1. Calculate scores for all available gear
2. Distribute optimal gear to each hero without conflicts
3. Return replaced items to inventory
4. Update all UI elements and recalculate stats

### Code Location
Function: `autoEquip()` in `index.html` (lines 4160-4235)

## üß™ Testing

A comprehensive test suite is available in `test_enhanced_features.html` that validates:
- Individual feature functionality
- Integration between all features
- Edge cases and error handling
- UI responsiveness

### Running Tests
1. Open `test_enhanced_features.html` in a browser
2. Click individual test buttons to validate each feature
3. Run the integration test to verify all features work together

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `index.html` - Main game file containing all three enhanced functions

### Dependencies
- Existing inventory system (`inv` array)
- Equipment mapping system (`equipMap` object)
- UI update functions (`refreshInv`, `refreshEquip`, `recalcStats`)
- Notification system (`notify` function)

### Backward Compatibility
All enhancements are backward compatible with the existing codebase. The original button bindings and UI elements remain unchanged.

### Performance Considerations
- Gift opening uses batch processing to prevent UI freezing
- Auto equip uses efficient sorting and filtering algorithms
- Autosell processes items in reverse order to avoid index shifting issues

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Configurable Pricing**: Allow users to customize item prices
2. **Equipment Sets**: Support for equipment set bonuses
3. **Hero Preferences**: Allow customization of which heroes get priority for certain item types
4. **Batch Size Configuration**: Allow users to adjust gift opening batch size
5. **Advanced Filters**: More sophisticated item filtering options for autosell
