# Project structure (placeholder)

This docs/ folder contains a lightweight structure file describing the repository layout.

- `A1K Runner.htm` — main game HTML used for local testing.
- `src/` — recommended location for modular JS sources (placeholder).
- `assets/` — image and sprite assets used by the game (already present).
- `tests_smoke/` — Playwright smoke tests.

When refactoring, move inline scripts from the HTML into `src/` and bundle into `build/`.
